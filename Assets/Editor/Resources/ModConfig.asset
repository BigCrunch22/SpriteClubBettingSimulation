    NOTE:

    This module is not intended for regular gameplay. Internet connection is also
    needed for the module.


    Adding TP support might not be necessary for this module.


    Issues with the module ATM (that I know):

    -Syncing issue during transition to another battle (this one is really hard to
    fix since Twitch stream and the site do not really sync. There is also lack of
    data to gather to make it reliable)

    -Behaviour of the module during lack of internet connection (still trying to fix
    that)

    -No failsafe during the moment that it does not gather the proper data (still
    trying to fix that)
